# nShahid

For some reason, the people behind Shahid for Android decided not to support Android TV!
Shahid is a NetFlix-like platform for middle east media content.

This is a very simple app that installs/updates/opens Shahid on Android TV.

## ToDo

- not sure if possible, but if Shahid can be forced to run in Landscape, it will be nice.
